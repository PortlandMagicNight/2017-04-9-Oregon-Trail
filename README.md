This month, we're going to build the popular RPG from 1990, The Oregon Trail.  To set the scene, you're a pioneer ready to set out on the Oregon Trail.  With a head full of big dreams, and a pocket of cash, you've got some choices to make, and many more choices await along the way.  All of them affect your and your party's chances of making it all the way to Oregon City.  Will you succeed?  Its going to take a clear head, good decisions, and a fair bit of luck to make it through.  Safe Travels Homesteader!
